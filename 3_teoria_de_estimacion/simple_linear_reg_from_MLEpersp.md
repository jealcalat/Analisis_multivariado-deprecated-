Here is a pdf file link to study simple linear regression from a maximum likelihood estimation perspectiveÂ¹Â²Â³:

- Simple Linear Regression: Maximum Likelihood EstimationÂ¹
- Linear Regression via Maximization of the LikelihoodÂ²
- The Method of Maximum Likelihood for Simple Linear RegressionÂ³

I hope this helps you learn more about the topic.ðŸ˜Š
